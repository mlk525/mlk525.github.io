# Reflection/Evaluation
After

Mind Space is an audio-visual letter writing experience aimed at raising awareness for mental health. The page begins with a message for the user to have their first interaction with, and by clicking a button, they are directed to the main page with an intro audio of Mike & I describing the experience of the webpage. The audio intends to locate us in a coffee shop, where we meet to tell users about Mind Space. When the audio is done, users are directed to an empty letter, where they could write any thoughts they have in mind, whether to themselves or an open letter to anyone, we just want that empty space to manifest feelings users may not want inside of them. While writing the letter, the keyboard has piano notes and every letter typed would be visualized with randomly colored circles popping up, which is intended to display the emotions of the user through words. When the send button is clicked, their letter gets animated into an envelope, which represents that their thoughts are now safe inside it. Users get to choose to write another letter if they wish or learn more about mental health through resources given to them.

For implementation, we were striving for a basic visual design and focus more on the audio. Working on the wireframe, I had just put random lines across the page to represent the ‘minimal design’ we would actually use in the web page, but we turned out to like the idea of the lines actually representing thoughts in our minds. Thinking about it more, we designed the landing page to have the most complicated lines, then as the user experiences gets to the main page where the first audio is played, the lines become less complex as the calm background music intends to give a relaxing mood. We also wanted to give the user the chance to skip down to the letter by clicking on the arrows on the left anytime through the intro audio if they think they want to. When the user goes to the letter writing, the lines become the least complicated, since writing down thoughts and feelings makes you understand them and gain more control of your emotions. The piano notes are also part of the letter writing, spilling out complex thoughts process. Every letter and word written would let out a different emotion with the different piano notes released and the different colors of the circles. The circles intend to release the emotions of the user as they write, because we feel things always, even if our thoughts are not complex (which is signified through the little lines). The sounds of the piano notes would seem loud because it intends to display complex thoughts that turn into words when letter writing. The ending footer comes up when the user clicks on ‘send’, which have 2 options, writing a new letter and learning more about mental health through a link of resources. There are two intended contrasts worth mentioning: the contrast between the calm background and loud piano notes, and the contrast between the simple lines on the letter page and the colorful circles coming out when typing; both of those signify a calm mood while listening to the intro and outro audio, but also a state of acknowledging feelings and spilling them out during the letter writing experience.

The colors of the overall page (excluding the colored circles coming out when typing) are limited to shades of blue, yellow, and light purple, the universal colors meant to represent mental health awareness. Several issues came up while working on this project, including refreshing the letter for ‘write a new letter’, integrating the intro and outro sounds were a challenging aspect – but normal since it’s my first experience with sounds on the web. The visuals, design, layout, letter writing and animation, footer ending options, and recording intro and outro sounds were elements that I mainly worked on developing.

Overall, our expectations were almost fully met in this project, from the design to audio to the full experience. In addition to the elements of the webpage, we wanted to add an option for the user to share their letter by generating a link after the send button is pressed – but due to time constraints we mainly focused on developing the more important elements of the page. The final working version is almost exactly like our wireframe and what we had in mind initially, but with small changes in the page elements, design, and colors.

Keyboard Test

Testing out typing in the key of C Major

The github repo I'm using is a clone of [Patatap](https://patatap.com/), which is an animation and sound website.
Pressing any key from A to Z will produce notes. I'm trying to make every letter key produce a note crom the C Major arpeggio (C, E, G). JavaScript sound library in use: Howler.js
