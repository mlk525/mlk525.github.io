# Keyboard Test

## Testing out typing in the key of C Major

The github repo I'm using is a clone of [Patatap](https://patatap.com/), which is an animation and sound website.
Pressing any key from A to Z will produce notes. I'm trying to make every letter key produce a note crom the C Major arpeggio (C, E, G). JavaScript sound library in use: Howler.js
