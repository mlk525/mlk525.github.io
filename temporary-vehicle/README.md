# Art and Activism Activity
## Gabi, Suzan, Liyan, Michael

### Choose an artist or artwork from the Interventionist Catalogue or the lecture that excited or resonated with you. How would you update that artwork today, or connect it to an issue you feel passionate about? In small groups create a work of political art that updates and/or re-focuses your chosen artist/artwork.
### Title, describe, document and prepare to share your work for critique in class. Upload documentation to Classes.


For this assignment, we decided to update the Homeless Vehicle project by Krzysztof Wodiczko which took place in the late 1980s in New York City. Although this project has a physical adaptation that offered both practical and symbolic functions, we decided to reflect the similar symbolic meanings and adapt it to new media.


The students are given a link that will randomly choose between the website with full information, and the website with missing information, and they would all have to take the quiz. The students who randomly received less information, will not have enough information to pass the quiz. For us, the symbolic representation of our project that was adapted from the Homeless Vehicle were the state of statelessness, temporary lives, and the unequal access of information and resources about one's own living situation.
